I started creating videos back in 2021 and my channel has over 200 videos. The idea was to make short, easy-to-understand videos that covered a specific topic.

## Data structures in Python

This playlist covers the core concepts behind basic data structures (linked list, stack, queue, binary tree, graph), time complexities, and simple implementations.

## Javascript Playlist

This playlist (60+ videos) covers basic-intermediate javascript concepts like IDE, variables, expressions, IIFE, scopes, data types, functions, error handling, and OOP. It's structured to be watched in order, and can be used as a reference for core js concepts.

## Git & GitHub for beginners

This playlist (12 videos) covers basic Git concepts including version control, branches, pull requests, and more.

## Future 

I have plans to cover architecture patterns and best practices in fullstack development. Let me know if you have interesting ideas.
